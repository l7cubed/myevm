# Litepaper and Open Letter: The RainETH Initiative

## Executive Summary

In the spirit of innovation, community, and the transformative power of blockchain technology, we are excited to introduce the RainETH initiative. This endeavor is inspired by the story of Rain Lõhmus, the esteemed founder of LHV Bank, who experienced the unfortunate loss of access to 250,000 Ether (ETH) due to misplaced private keys. Our project aims to transcend the traditional constraints of asset ownership and leverage the collective power of community coordination to foster a unique value-creation ecosystem. RainETH is not just a token; it's a testament to the resilience and creativity of the decentralized finance (DeFi) community.


## Introduction

Blockchain and cryptocurrency have always been about pushing boundaries—reimagining what's possible in terms of ownership, value exchange, and community. The RainETH initiative embodies this ethos by proposing a novel approach to perceived loss and communal benefit. Drawing upon the principles discussed in renowned works like "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari, we recognize that the structures and systems governing our lives are constructs of shared belief and coordinated action. RainETH represents an opportunity to apply these insights in a practical, impactful manner within the blockchain space.

## Project Overview

The RainETH initiative will introduce a bespoke token, rainETH, on the Base chain, symbolically representing the 250,000 ETH lost by Mr. Lõhmus. This initiative will take place on the reputable platform Party.app through their new product “Rooms” that enables users to launch bonding curve membership community groups each with its distinct curve dynamics. Transaction fees generated within these rooms (10% to the room's reserve, 2.5% to the developers, and 2.5% to the room creator) will serve as a foundational economic mechanism, driving value and utility within the RainETH Initiative ecosystem.

## Value Proposition and Community Benefit

Our vision is twofold: to offer a tangible avenue for Mr. Lõhmus to derive value from his lost assets symbolically and to create a vibrant, self-sustaining community around RainETH. The reserve ETH accrued from transaction fees will be strategically deployed to provide liquidity in various base chain AMM pools paired with RainETH, facilitating robust trading and liquidity provision opportunities for participants. This mechanism not only honors the lost ETH but also constructs a new realm of value creation and sharing among community members.

We have launched three different bonding curve governing bodies called Collective, Prime, and VIP to create competition and cater to different risk tolerances through gamification. Exact reward distribution mechanics and reembursement payouts are yet to be confirmed, but we aim to direct proportional rewards/benefits based on activity and ecosystem value.

### Interview Mention released on 31.10.2023

> "It's no secret that I have a wallet with 250,000 Ethereum units, anyone can calculate for themselves what it's worth. That's hundreds of millions? Yeah, and I can't solve this alone; if someone thinks they can, I'll take all offers. My own best plan is to build Rain Lõhmus as an AI and see if he can get his memories back. But no, I take it easy. I don't like things that result in zero or one. You can spend ten years on it, and it might end up with zero; it might end up with you solving a problem, but I prefer to do things where progress is visible on a daily basis."

## Open Letter to Mr. Rain Lõhmus

Dear Mr. Lõhmus,

We are reaching out to share the RainETH initiative, a community-driven project inspired by the story of innovation and the unfortunate loss of access to a significant Ethereum holding. RainETH represents our collective belief in the power of community, coordination, and the positive potential of blockchain technology. We extend an invitation for you to join us in this venture, not just as the inspiration behind it but as a beneficiary of the value it seeks to create.

In the face of loss, we see opportunity—a chance to come together, to innovate, and to build something that benefits all involved. The RainETH community stands as a testament to what we can achieve when we unite under a shared vision and purpose. We look forward to the possibility of your involvement and to the many ways we can collectively navigate the future of decentralized finance.

Warm regards,
The RainETH Initiative Communities

## Future Work and Safety Measures

The RainETH initiative is more than a project; it's a movement towards harnessing the collective will and creativity of the DeFi community to redefine the narratives around loss and opportunity in the blockchain space. We invite all who share in our vision to join us in this groundbreaking endeavor.

We eagerly await the launch of Panoptic.xyz's option protocols on various L2 networks. Once deployed on basechain, we will make it a priority to enable the risk management and insurance like protections that options can offer. Furthermore, we chose established and trusted infrastructure to build on with safety in mind. We are happy to call Party.app home and pust boundries with Thridweb.com's audited contracts.

For further details and participation inquiries, please join a private dao chat. For very important matter you can contact yo@myevm.org. This litepaper serves as an initial proposal and invitation for collaboration. We eagerly anticipate the diverse contributions and insights from the community as we refine and advance this initiative.

### Experimental Future Considerations:

* Parity Bug ETH: 500,000 ETH said to be lost forever due to a deleted smart contract wallet library aimed to benefit participants and users who lost funds.

* Important to note: 
While interesting to explore, any of these may upset people who base financial decision based on this information. This knowledge will be considered in every decision in our future.
+Verifiable Satoshi BTC or landfill BTC
+Burn Address tokens
+Other loses are consider lost forever (not in circulation)

## Disclaimer

Please be advised that the intrinsic value of RainETH tokens is subject to the collective judgment and acceptance of the community. These tokens represent a symbolic venture, predicated on a narrative of loss and communal opportunity within the decentralized finance ecosystem. As such, their valuation is inherently speculative and determined by the market participants' shared belief in their worth.

It is crucial to acknowledge that should the Ethereum (ETH) from wallet address 0x2B6eD29A95753C3Ad948348e3e7b1A251080Ffb9 become accessible and the funds therein are moved, the RainETH tokens will unequivocally lose their speculative value and be deemed worthless. This eventuality serves as a reminder of the speculative nature of such tokens and underscores the importance of participant discretion and the acknowledgment of associated risks.

Participants are urged to engage with RainETH tokens with a full understanding of this context. The initiative, while embodying the spirit of community and innovation, also navigates the complexities of speculative assets within the blockchain domain. Thus, involvement should be measured, informed, and aligned with personal risk tolerance and investment philosophy.
